1.	Use GUI to align CeO2 pattern to get approximate x, y, and z location of
    detectors.

2.	Save detector config file.

3.	Use preprocess_dex.py to create imageseries for dual dexela setup.
    - Note: calls chess.py so you need to make sure thatâ€™s in the same folder!
    - Note 2: Currently hardcoded for the 360 degree, 0.25 degree step size case

4.	Copy detector config to a new file. This is to make sure you have the
    original powder calibration in case you need it later.

5.  Make sure this block exists in the instrument config with "distortion" at
    the same indentation level as "buffer" and "pixels".

distortion:
  function_name: Dexela_2923
  parameters:
  - 0.0
  - 0.0
  - 0.0
  - 0.0
  - 0.0
  - 0.0
  - 0.0
  - 0.0


6.	Find orientations and fit grains using CLI. Use a tth_width of 0.35 or
    something similar. It needs to be larger than usual since this is the first
    full calibration step.

7.	Use calibrate_instrument_from_rotation_series.py using one or more of the
    ruby grains (line 54).

8.	Find orientations and fit grains again using CLI with the re-calibrated
    detector.
    - Note: Can now use a smaller tth width.
